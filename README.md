<H1>Development of a Library System (V1.0)</H1>
Our teamâ€™s project is focused on the creation of a library system that primarily focuses on the borrowing feature of a library. The library system will be created as an app as we believe the mobility of a mobile device is handy for librarians that want to check and see book. Furthermore, our application is centred around 5 main features. Our primary feature will be the ability to check in and check out, this system will function around our book database that tracks our stock of books. Aside from borrowing and returning books, we also want to implement a simple filtering tool. There is another feature we decided to implement, which is the idea of an individual account. Users and administrators will have their own accounts, each with different access levels. Administrators have access to the addition and removal of borrowable books in the database of books. To support the library in terms of its security, we have decided to implement a tracking system for books. If a person has borrowed 2 books or an overdue book (books borrowed for over 2 weeks) they are unable to borrow more. Our databases will use a file-based system for our first iteration of this project. <br/>

Shown above is how our classes are organized in the library system. The methods used for each class is as follows: <br/>
mainMethod: <br/>
*add something here** <br/>

User abstract: <br/>
login(); <br/>
etc etc

Admin class: Subclass of User <br/>

User Class: Subclass of User <br/>


##<H2>Our Work Breakdown Structure</H2>
Highlighting our team's distribution of responsibilities, we've created a work breakdown structure (WBS) to further help with the project management.<br/>

## <H2>Gantt Chart and Scheduling Our Project</H2>
For our project listed below is a rough estimation for the development of this project. This Gantt chart would hopefully help in estimating and guiding our development.
